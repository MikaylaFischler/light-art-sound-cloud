# WPI Light Art - Sound Cloud Project
This project will consist of control through a Teensy 3.6 using Teensy Audio Board to use audio input to generate LED patterns on a cotton ball coated frame, giving off a soft, naturally diffused glow. The use of cotton balls led to this project being named "Sound Cloud".
